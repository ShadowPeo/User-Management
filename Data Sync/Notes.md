    -   The Borrower image default size is 144 (width) x 192 (height) pixels. Images that are larger or smaller than the default pixel size are scaled to fit. Large file sizes can slow down the performance of the Circulation Desk. If Borrower records are taking too long to appear it may be necessary to reduce the size of the images. If possible, images larger than 50,000 bytes (48.828 kb) should be avoided.
